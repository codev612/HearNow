# Use Meeting Mode Real-Time Prompt

When the user asks questions or requests assistance, **always check the current meeting mode** and use its associated real-time prompt to guide your responses.

## How to Determine Current Mode

1. **Check the current session**: Look for `MeetingProvider.currentSession` or `MeetingSession` instances in the codebase
2. **Get the modeKey**: The session has a `modeKey` property (e.g., "general", "interview", "custom:{id}")
3. **Retrieve the config**: Use `MeetingModeService.getConfigForModeKey(modeKey)` to get the `MeetingModeConfig`
4. **Use the realTimePrompt**: The config contains a `realTimePrompt` field that defines how to respond

## Important: Prompts Are User-Editable

**The real-time prompts are stored in the application's data** (SharedPreferences locally, MongoDB when synced) and can be edited by users in the **Mode Manage Page** (`lib/screens/manage_mode_page.dart`). 

- Built-in modes have default prompts (see `MeetingModeService.getDefaultConfig()`), but users can customize them
- Custom modes are fully user-defined with their own prompts
- **Always check the actual stored prompt**, not just the defaults

## Meeting Modes

The application supports these built-in modes (see `lib/models/meeting_mode.dart`):
- General, Interview, Presentation, Discussion, Lecture, Meeting, Call, Brainstorm, Other

Each mode can have its prompt customized via the Mode Manage Page. Custom modes can also be created with completely custom prompts.

## Implementation

When responding to user queries:
1. **Identify the context**: If working with meeting-related code or discussing meeting features, check the current mode
2. **Adapt your response**: Use the real-time prompt as guidance for how to frame your assistance
3. **Mode-specific focus**: Tailor your responses to match the mode's purpose (e.g., interview mode = focus on candidate evaluation, brainstorm mode = focus on idea capture)

## Example

If the current mode is "interview" and the user asks about improving the AI responses:
- Frame suggestions around interview assistance (identifying qualifications, strengths, concerns)
- Consider interview-specific features and use cases
- Think about how interviewers would use the tool
